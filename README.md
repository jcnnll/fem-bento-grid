## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Use visual order to change the position of images to preserve the integrity of the document flow and image association with the appropriate text content.
- Don't over-engineer basic static single page sites.
- A little layering and custom props goes a long way.

### Useful resources

- [How to Use Bento Grids Design in Your Web Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/bento-grids-in-web-design/) - This provided a good introduction to the concepts behind Bento Grid Design.
- [Responsive Bento Grid | CSS Tutorial | Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4dHvo09cG4) - Great Youtube tutorial by Kevin Powell demonstrating some great CSS practices while at the same time providing a solid solution to the challenge. I used this as my main source of learning for this topic and really appreciate the way that Keven demonstrates how to organise CSS code in layers, logically laying out the case for using visual ordering to maintain HTML context for images and overall simplifying the implementation using robust CSS techniques to address the layout challenges.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) and the great tutorial he put together for this challenge. My initial approach relied on a class naming strategy but after seeing what he managed to do using the nth child strategy I decided to follow the same approach given the static nature of this project. I really appreciate finding his tutorial while I was researching the project,it saved me from going into unnecessary complexity and provided the perspective I needed to really get the concept of implementing more complex grid designs using basic CSS.
